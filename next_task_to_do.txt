1️⃣ Python ETL Scripts

Options:

Azure Data Factory (ADF) – good for visual pipelines, can run Python scripts via “Custom Activity” in a batch way.

Azure Synapse Pipelines – similar to ADF, more enterprise-level analytics, usually for very large scale.

Azure Databricks – fully Python/Notebook friendly, optimized for data transformations, works well with Parquet and large datasets.

Recommendation for you:

✅ Azure Databricks

Reasons:

Your ETL is already in Python – no need to rewrite in another language.

Handles Parquet files, transformations, and gold layer very efficiently.

Works seamlessly with ADLS (Data Lake).

Supports incremental load, pandas, PySpark, etc.

Easy to schedule jobs and monitor pipeline runs.

ADF is good if you want more “click-and-drag” pipelines, but since your project is Python-heavy and already structured, Databricks is the cleanest fit.

2️⃣ Logging & Metadata

Options:

Azure SQL Database – fully managed, easy to connect with Python (SQLAlchemy).

Azure SQL Managed Instance – more enterprise-grade, almost like full SQL Server in cloud.

Recommendation for you:

✅ Azure SQL Database

Reasons:

Fully managed – no server maintenance.

Works well with SQLAlchemy (your current ORM setup).

Perfect for ETL run logs and step logs.

Cost-effective for your project size.

Easy to connect with both Databricks and ADF if needed later.

Managed Instance is overkill unless you need full SQL Server features or very high-scale enterprise.
